This is a new feature and bug fix release. We added full support for all
new Bacula 15.0 config directives. Apart from that we added to deploy API
host window a connection test button to check if connection parameters are
valid before starting deploy process. At the end we fixed bugs reported by
the Community.

We would like to take this opportunity to thank you all the Bacularis Community
for actively reporting to us new feature requests and bug reports.
