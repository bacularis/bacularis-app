This is a minor bug fix release. We fixed problems that were detected by static
code analysis tools and we did a couple of other minor fixes. Apart from that
there has been improved logging/debugging to file. We slightly changed the log
format to make logs more readable. At the end we introduced changes to automate
code analysing and releasing process. We hope it will help in providing new releases
more frequent.

Changes:
 - Create CONTRIBUTING.md
 - Create CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
 - Fix qrcodejs version in composer.json
 - Update LICENSE file
 - Update dependencies in composer.json
