This is a bug fix release. We fixed bugs reported after releasing version ``2.2.0``.
The most significant is a bug with displaying jobs that can experience MySQL/MariaDB users.
Besides of that we fixed a bug with displaying volume edit drawer in dark mode. At the end
we added a new job status column to the job table and we created a new deploy OS profiles for
Fedora 39 and Ubuntu 23.10 Mantic.
