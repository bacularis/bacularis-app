# Welcome to Bacularis contributing guide

Thank you for interesting in our project and for your willingness to contribute to it. Your contribution will be added to the Bacularis to make it better for users.

Please read our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to keep our community respectable and communication healthy.

In this guide you will find information about how you can contribute and how to prepare new changes. Let's start.

## Getting started

### Main repository

The main Bacularis reporsitory in GitHub is named ``bacularis-app``. It is a place where not happens too much in matter of new code, because we have other repositories for that, but where we have a base of bug reports and new feature requests.

### Bugs

If you find a bug, you can report it using [new issue form](https://github.com/bacularis/bacularis-app/issues/new/choose) in the ``bacularis-app`` repository. Before doing that it is a good practice to do a quick review [existing issues](https://github.com/bacularis/bacularis-app/issues) to see if the bug was already reported.

### Feature requests

In case you have an idea for a good new function for Bacularis, you can report it in the same way as reporting bugs using the [new issue form](https://github.com/bacularis/bacularis-app/issues/new/choose)

### Translations

Would you like to use Bacularis in your native language but you donâ€™t see your language on the supported language list? Do you speak also English? It can be a good opportunity to become the Bacularis translator and to translate the Bacula web interface into your language. If you decide of doing that, please read our [Translators Guide](https://bacularis.app/doc/contributions/translations.html) in the Bacularis documentation. You find there all procedure how to prepare, check and publish translations.

### Patches

You can prepare a fix or improvement in a patch form. To add your changes to main repositories we use GitHub pull requests. Before contributing patches please read our [Developers Guide](https://bacularis.app/doc/contributions/patches.html) in the Bacularis documentation.

Thank you in advance for all your contributions!
